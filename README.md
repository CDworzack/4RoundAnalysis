# 4RoundAnalysis
This repository includes the Python code used for my Master Thesis 'Analysis of Clustering Trails in Differentials over Iterartive Permutations'

The code was written in Python and is made available via a JupyterLab data file for easy access, use and adaptation. 

The actuals code is supplied in the file '4-Round-Differential'.
The trail core used in the Thesis is supplied in file 'weight 80 cores'.
To use the code for analysis of other trail cores, change the path to the input file (search for 'PATH'). 

Full documentation, background and ways of adapting this to any permuation can be found in my Thesis XXX.
